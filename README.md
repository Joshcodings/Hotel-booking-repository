# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

This project explores a real-world hotel booking dataset to uncover trends in cancellations, guest behavior, and seasonal patterns using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains bookings made at a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes detailed features like:

- Arrival dates (year, month, day)
- Length of stay (weekend vs weekday nights)
- Number of adults, children, and babies
- Booking source (agent, company, country)
- Room preferences vs assigned rooms
- Cancellation status
- Revenue-related details (ADR - Average Daily Rate)
- Special requests and parking spaces

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📆 **Monthly Trends:** Peak bookings occur between July and August.
- ❌ **Cancellations:** Higher lead time increases cancellation probability.
- 🌍 **Top Guest Countries:** Portugal, United Kingdom, and France are top origins.
- 🔁 **Repeated Guests:** Very few guests are repeat customers.
- 🛏️ **Room Allocation:** There are frequent mismatches between reserved and assigned rooms.
- 💵 **Revenue Trends:** City hotel generates higher average daily revenue.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Line plots for monthly booking trends
- Pie charts showing country distribution and cancellation ratios
- Bar plots comparing guest types, room types, and special requests
- Heatmaps for correlations

## 🚀 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
